    <dd>Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isnâ€™t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today.
